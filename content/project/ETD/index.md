Put forward an **efficient time delay attack detection scheme (ETD)** to detect time delay attack in UAV networks, which is a less explored attack surface. First, we conduct a comprehensive selection of delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely **delay, node, message and connection**, based on which one-class classification is used for model training. Then, the forwarding behaviours of all nodes can be evaluated and their trust values can be obtained, based on which benign nodes can be distinguished from malicious ones.
