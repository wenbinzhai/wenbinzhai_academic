Designed an efficient **spatial-temporal range aggregation query processing (ESTA)** algorithm for UAV networks. Based on the constructed **topology change graph (TCG)**, an efficient **shortest path algorithm** is proposed to obtain the user query delay. Then ESTA transforms the aggregation processing of query results into recursively solving the **set cover problem**, thus constructing a **spatial-temporal aggregation tree (STAT)** to find an efficient in-network aggregation routing path for query results without sacrificing the user query delay.
