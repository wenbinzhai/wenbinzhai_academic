Proposed a **power-aware routing (PAR)** algorithm to optimize energy consumption in delay-constrained UAV networks which takes the **adjustable power** of UAVs into consideration and utilizes the **pre-planned trajectory information** to calculate encounters at different power levels, thereby constructing a **power-aware encounter tree** to find the transmission path with minimum energy consumption from the source to the destination within the delay constraint. (2020-2021, published in conference **WASA 2022 [CCF C]**)
