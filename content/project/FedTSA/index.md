Working on designing a **federated semi-supervised and semi-asynchronous learning (FedTSA)** for anomaly detection in IoT networks, which considers a more realistic semi-supervised scenario for IoT networks. A **semi-asynchronous model update and staleness tolerant distribution scheme** is proposed to achieve the trade-off between the round efficiency and detection performance, and **the staleness of local models and the participation frequency of clients** are considered to balance the contributions to the global model. In addition, a **group-based** aggregation function is conducted to deal with the non-IID data, and the **difference transmission** based on the sparse matrix is adopted to reduce the communication cost.
